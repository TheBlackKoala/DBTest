How to run the code:
'dotnet run' should execute the program.

If anything should fail during execution please change your locale (language) settings to en-DK.

The program will try to import from TaxSchedule.sqlite. If this fails for any reason it will default to trying to parse the file "municipalities.txt".

Press H or T in the program for help or a tutorial on how to use the program.






Municipalitiy names are case-insensitive.



Assumptions about how the code is to work:
From the example in the case text there are a few things that are not stated clearly which have led to these assumptions.

There are four different taxes:
Daily
Weekly
Monthly
Yearly
Daily tax overshadows weekly, monthly and yearly tax, like weekly overshadows monthly and yearly, etc. So on a day with a daily tax no other tax will be calculated and on a day with no daily tax but with a weekly tax only this will be calculated.



Further work:
Extending the database system to not add duplicates to the database.
Allowing updates directly to the database
Allowing updates/removals of records, these should also be implemented for the database when updating this.
A regular commandline API
Deploying as a self-hosted service.
More tests - always more tests
