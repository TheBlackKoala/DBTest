How to run the code:








Assumptions about how the code is to work:
From the example in the case text there are a few things that are not stated clearly which have led to these assumptions.

There are four different taxes:
Daily
Weekly
Monthly
Yearly
Daily tax overshadows weekly, monthly and yearly tax, like weekly overshadows monthly and yearly etc. So on a day with a daily tax no other tax will be calculated and on a day with no daily tax but with a weekly tax only this will be calculated.

To avoid throwing errors we return an impossible value on days where no tax is scheduled - Negative Infinity. This is to show that the tax on the day is not set, rather than set to another value, e.g. 0 or 1.
